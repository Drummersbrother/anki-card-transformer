# IB Smart-prep flashcard maker
These scripts (the run-all one does what it you think it does) create anki-decks for all (except some maths cards) flashcards from the IB smart-prep site. 
I have not included an auth token, nor anything else that requires a subscription, in the code; but the only file that need to be modified is the `parameters_template.py` file. 
All of this is, as far as I know, not breaking the terms of use of the IB smart prep site, since it is only for personal use and I don't include any protected info in the code.
